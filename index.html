<h2 id="2">What Type of the Towing Mirror Is Best for Your Caravan and Motorhome?</h2>
<p>The first call you make is to your insurance agent to see what towing outfit they recommend and to explain to them what just happened. Your agent gives you the towing company information and even offers to call for you. While you're waiting for the tow truck to come rescue you, it comes to you that you forgot to ask your agent if they would pay to either fix your flat tire or get you a new tire. So, you call the agent back and are told that no, the tire with a nail in it is not covered by your insurance policy but your towing is. This revelation is a surprise to you, why isn't your tire covered? it's part of your car. The fact is, even if the nail was stuck in a piece of wood and by you running over it and causing it to fly up and crash into one of our windows, it demolishes the window, the tire still wouldn't be covered but the window would.</p>
